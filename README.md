# p2-twitter-analysis
##The effects of Covid-19 in Sports and their fans:
  Our project will consist of looking at the interaction between fans and their favorite sports. To accomplish this we will look at the four most popular sports: Soccer, Basketball, Baseball, and Football. Within these sport categories we will take a closer look at the most popular teams of every category to obtain a large set of data. Here are some of the questions we look to answer:
  
1) Analyze the stats (likes, retweets, new followers, etc...) for the top teams of each sport prior to March 2020.
2) Analyze the stats (likes, retweets, new followers, etc...) for the top teams of each sport in the months of Arpil-June, July-Sept
3) Analyze the stats (likes, retweets, new followers, etc...) for the top teams of each sport right now using streaming data.
4) From the data we have gathered, and the conclusions we have come up with, what predictions/projections can we make about fans and their interactions with their favorite teams in a couple of months from  now?

### Requirements:
- Create a Spark Application that processes Twitter data
- Your project 2 pitch should involve some analysis of twitter data.  This can be the central feature.  Your final application should work, to some extent, with both streaming and historical data.
- Send me a link to a git repo, have someone in the group manage git (but they can ask for help from me)
- Produce a one or more .jar files for your analysis.  Multiple smaller jar files are preferred.

### Presentations
- Bring a simple slide deck providing an overview of your results.  You should present your results, a high level overview of the process used to achieve those results, and any assumptions and simplifications you made on the way to those results.
- I may ask you to run an analysis on the day of the presentation, so be prepared to do so.
- We'll have 20 minutes per group, so make sure your presentation can be covered in that time, focusing on the parts of your analysis you find most interesting.
- Include a link to your github repository at the end of your slides

### Technologies
- Apache Spark
- Spark SQL
- YARN
- HDFS and/or S3
- Scala 2.12.10

### Due Date
